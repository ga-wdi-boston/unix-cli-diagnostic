## Navigating the Filesystem

Complete each of following steps, **in order** :

1. Create a new directory called `quiz` inside the root directory of this repository (`cli-08-assessment`).

2. Create a new file inside `quiz` called `rhyme.txt`.

3. Open `rhyme.txt` using Sublime (via the terminal) and add the following text:

 "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain."

 Once you've done this, save the file and quit.

4. Make a directory inside `quiz` called `temp`. Inside it, create a new blank file called `temp.md`.

5. Navigate back up to `quiz`, and delete the `temp` directory (with `temp.md` inside of it).
Use `ls` to show the contents of `quiz` - was `temp` deleted?

## Absolute and Relative Paths

Open up this file in your text editor, and write your answers below (where indicated).

1. Is `/Users/blah_blah/Desktop` a relative path or an absolute path? How do you know?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
 It is a relative path because of the /
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->

2. Suppose that we're working on a project, and we want to use a font that's being hosted somewhere on the internet. Would we use an absolute or relative path to refer to it? Why?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
 An absolute path becuase we want to refer to the location of the file and directories within the file system.
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->

3. Now suppose that we have an image file living inside our project. Would we refer to it with an absolute or relative path? Why?

 <!-- Answer Starts Here -->
 We would refer to it with a relative path because it is relative to the root directory.
 <!-- Answer Ends Here -->
